## Ship-to-Ship Transfer Detection in SAR Images
### Overview
This project aims at detecting Ship-to-Ship (STS) transfers and ships in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1. The project focuses on the Laconian Gulf area and utilizes a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model to analyze SAR images. The model was trained on a curated dataset created with CVAT, which includes labeled SAR images of ships and STS-transfers. The dataset will be made available soon. Additionally, the repository includes a Dash dashboard for visualizing the results.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enhance maritime surveillance by accurately identifying STS transfers and ships in SAR images. This is achieved by matching detections with Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, providing a comprehensive view of maritime activities in the Laconian Gulf.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of labeled SAR images of ships and STS-transfers, created using CVAT. This dataset is crucial for training and validating the models used in the project. The link to the dataset will be updated shortly.

### Dashboard
The repository includes a Dash dashboard designed to visualize the results of the STS transfer detection and ship identification. This dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the data, offering insights into the effectiveness of the detection models and the accuracy of the AIS data matching.

### Getting Started
